        <b>Programming:</b> I've been coding since I was 12 and although I
        don't have any <i>stunning</i> projects to show, I believe I am a
        pretty decent programmer. My main language is Java, but I also
        sometimes write code in C++.
    </p>

        <b>Drawing:</b> I never intended to become good at drawing,
        therefore I don't draw too well, but good enough. I enjoy
        drawing, but I often get frustrated when I can't do something.
        You can find some of my artworks in my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/avatwho/" class="inline-button">Instagram</a>.
