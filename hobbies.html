        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Programming:</b> I've been coding since I was 12 and although I
            don't have any <i>stunning</i> projects to show, I believe I am a
            pretty decent programmer. My main language is Java, but I also
            sometimes write code in C++.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Drawing:</b> I never intended to become good at drawing,
            therefore I don't draw too well, but good enough. I enjoy
            drawing, but I often get frustrated when I can't do something.
            You can find some of my artworks in my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/avatwho/" class="inline-button">Instagram</a>.
