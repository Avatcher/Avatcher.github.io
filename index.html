        Hello!<br>
        I am Avatcher.

<div id="content">
    <article>
        <h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
        I am a Ukrainian student, who enjoys coding, particurarly using
        <b>Java</b>, <b>C++</b> and just a little bit of <b>Rust</b>.
        Besides programming I also have other hobbies:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Drawing:</h2><br>
                I am not really good in drawing, as I get frustrated everytime
                I fail to draw something, although the nische I partially mastered
                is Pixel-Art. I started to draw it as fan-arts for some videogames,
                and at some point I just could draw well enough, I could be proud
                of. I still have no idea how to draw people, but what I can is
                pretty much enough for my needs. I find drawing more <b>userful</b>
                skill, rather than something, that brings me happiness.
                <!-- <img src="https://" alt="An Pixel-art drawing of mine"> -->
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Videogames:</h2><br>
                I have played videogames since very young age and the game, that will
                forever remain in my heart, is of course <b>Minecraft</b>, that
                partially made me into programming in the first place thanks to
                so-called "command blocks".
                <br><br>
                Although the game, that really inspired me to start programming was
                <b>Terraria</b>. Back then I was a part of one game's fan-community and
                decided to help one guy with creating a mod for the game by drawing
                sprites for him. But there was a problem: I always had too many
                ideas for the mod, that I used to tell him. Sadly he just could not do
                everything himself, even if he wanted, so I decided to start learning
                programming myself, partially to help him to develop the mod even more
                and to make my own ideas happen. So became <b>C#</b> my first programming
                language.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Books:</h2><br>
                Reading has always helped me to keep my head together. The best book,
                and the book, that made me into reading, surely was <b>Dune</b> of
                Herbert Frank. It is incredible story, that shared with me a ton of unusual
                and interesting ideas, that made me think a lot and changed how I look
                at the world around me. It is totally worth reading, although not
                everyone might like it, as I did.
